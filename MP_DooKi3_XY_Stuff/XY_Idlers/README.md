# SLM Printable XY Idlers for the Annex Engineering K3
These drives are designed to be SLM printed in aluminum (or other metals for $$$).  They allow for the toothed idlers to be changed to a full sized pulley with double shear.  Full sized bearings can take a lot more load than the smaller toothed idler bearings.  This should allow for full tension GT3 belts.

All bearings have been swapped to F695, the only exception are the files labeled for MF148 bearings.  There was one request to have the option to use 8mm shafts with couplers so I have included that option as well.

## Important Note

The bearing holes are intentionally undersized.  In order to get a snug fit, you will need to first drill and then ream the holes to size.

## BOM
In addition to the stock four GT2 9mm Pulleys you will need:
16 - F695 bearings
4 - additional GT2 9mm Pulleys
4 - 30mm D cut 5mm diameter shafts (for the idler pulley)

If you are using 8mm shafts and couplers swap all bearings to MF148 and all shafts to 8mm diameter
