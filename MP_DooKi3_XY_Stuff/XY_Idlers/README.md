# SLM Printable XY Idlers for the Annex Engineering K3
These drives are designed to be SLM printed in aluminum (or other metals for $$$).  They allow for the toothed idlers to be changed to a full sized pulley with double shear.  Full sized bearings can take a lot more load than the smaller toothed idler bearings.  This should allow for full tension GT3 belts.

All bearings have been swapped to F695.

## Important Note

The bearing holes are intentionally undersized.  In order to get a snug fit, you will need to first drill and then ream the holes to size.

### Approximate part weights
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_XY_XDrive_F695_V3: 42.7g
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_XY_YDrive_F695_V3: 41.6g
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_XY_XMAX_V3: 6.2g
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_XY_XMAX_Mirrored_V3: 6.2g 
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_XY_YMIN_V3: 6.9g
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_XY_YMIN_Mirrored_V3: 6.9g

## BOM
In addition to the stock four GT2 9mm Pulleys you will need:
- 16 - F695 bearings
- 4 - additional GT2 9mm Pulleys
- 4 - 35mm D cut 5mm diameter shafts (for the idler pulley)

If you are using 8mm shafts and couplers swap all bearings to MF148 and all shafts to 8mm diameter

## Updates
### 2024-08-07
- Reorganized the outdated parts folder and added version numbers for better tracking.
  - V1 are the original files
  - V2 have updated clearances and should be slightly lighter
- Updated XY idlers to V3 to allow for better clearances.
  - V3 will need the left Y rail shifted 10.5mm towards the front of the machine and the right Y rial shifted 10.5mm towards the rear of the machine.  This will allow for the idler stacks to be more easily removeable like the current Annex Engineering K3 625 bearing mounts.  All of the mounting bolts are oriented to thread into T-nuts in the vertical extrusions so shorter than standard allen wrenches are no longer needed.
