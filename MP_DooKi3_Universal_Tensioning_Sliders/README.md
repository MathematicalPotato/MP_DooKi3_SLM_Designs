# SLM Tensioning Sliders for X, Y, and Z Axes
These files are designed to be SLM printed out of aluminum.

## Notes
There are versions for 10mm (also compatible with 9mm) and 12mm belts.  Ensure you print the version for your XY setup.

These parts are oversized.  They will likely need sanded (on the side opposite the teeth) to ensure proper fitment belt retention.

Four sliders each have been combined into a single file for easier/cheaper printing.  They will need cut apart and sanded/filed to remove connecting the nubs. The Z Assembly will require one 10mm and XY will require either one 10mm or one 12mm depending on the XY tensioners ordered.
