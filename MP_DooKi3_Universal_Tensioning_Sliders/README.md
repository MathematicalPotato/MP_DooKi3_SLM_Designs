# SLM Tensioning Sliders for X, Y, and Z Axes
These files are designed to be SLM printed out of aluminum.

## Notes
There are versions for 10mm (also compatible with 9mm) and 12mm belts.  Ensure you print the version for your XY setup.

Four sliders each have been combined into a single file for easier/cheaper printing.  They will need cut apart and sanded/filed to remove connecting the nubs. The Z Assembly will require one 10mm and XY will require either one 10mm or one 12mm depending on the XY tensioners ordered.

## Updates
