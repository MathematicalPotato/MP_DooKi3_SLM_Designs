# SLM Z Idlers for the Z Axis of DooKi3 or Annex Engineering K3
These files are designed to be SLM printed out of aluminum.

## Notes
The shaft holes may need bored out to fit the idler shafts.

The shafts can held in with M3 set screws and/or retaining compound.  There are holes that either be tapped for M3 or drilled and tapped for M3 helicoils.  Helicoils are recommended for longevity.

All idlers will need two M3x4 set screws. The rear idler now uses two M5x10 for mounting.

These should be the approximate weights for these parts in aluminum:

MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Idler_Front: 24.3g

MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Idler_Front_Mirror: 24.3g

MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Idler_Rear: 37.4g
