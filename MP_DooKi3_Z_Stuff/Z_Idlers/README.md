# SLM Z Idlers for the Z Axis of DooKi3 or Annex Engineering K3
These files are designed to be SLM printed out of aluminum.

## Notes
The shaft holes may need bored out to fit the idler shafts.

The shafts can held in with M3 set screws and/or retaining compound.  There are holes that either be tapped for M3 or drilled and tapped for M3 helicoils.  Helicoils are recommended for longevity.

All idlers will need two M3x4 set screws. The rear idler now uses two M5x10 for mounting.

These should be the approximate weights for these parts in aluminum:

- MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Idler_Front: 14.5g
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Idler_Rear: 27.2g

## Updates
### 2024-08-20
- Added STLs.
- Updated Fronts to V5 and Rear to V4.  The Fronts are slightly shorter to allow for the updated SLM XY Idlers.
  - They are still fully compatible with stock and allow full travel.
  - The rear has been revised to be reversible.  This allows it to work with stock setups (idler positioned at the top) or setups with very long hotends (idler positioned at the bottom).
  - Weights have been significantly reduced for all as well.

### 2024-08-07
- Reorganized the outdated parts folder and added version numbers for better tracking.
  - V1 are the original files
  - V2 have updated clearances and should be slightly lighter
- Updated the front Z idlers to V3 with chamfers added to have better clearances.
