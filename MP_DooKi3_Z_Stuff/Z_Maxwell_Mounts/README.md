# SLM Z Maxwell Mounts for the Z Axis of DooKi3 or Annex Engineering K3
These files are designed to be SLM printed out of aluminum.


## Notes
The 8mm shaft holes in the maxwell mounts may need bored out to fit the shaft.

The 8mm shafts are designed to be held in with M3 bolts as set screws and/or retaining compound.  There are holes that either be tapped for M3 or drilled and tapped for M3 helicoils.  Helicoils are recommended for longevity.

These should be the approximate weights for these parts in aluminum:
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Maxwell_Front: 10.5g
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Maxwell_Rear_V3: 10.0g
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Maxwell_Clamp_V3: 0.9g

## Updates
### 2024-08-07
- Reorganized the outdated parts folder and added version numbers for better tracking.
  - V1 are the original files
  - V2 have updated clearances and should be slightly lighter
- Updated all Z maxwell mounts to V3.
  - This version uses clamps instead of set screws to hold the shafts in place.  This removes the need for post-processing the 8mm shaft hole to ensure fitment.
  - Added indexing lips to the bottoms to help with alignment during installation.
  - There are two clamp designs:
    - MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Maxwell_ClampPlate_V3_x3.dxf
      - This version is the recommended option.  You will need to get this DXF lasercut.  Mild steel in 3mm thickness is recommended as it should be cheaper and stronger than aluminum.
    - MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Maxwell_Clamp_V3_x3.step
      - This version is designed to be SLM printed. It will be more expensive and has the potential to be weaker depending on material choice.
