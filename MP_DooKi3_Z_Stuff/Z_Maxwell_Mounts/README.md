# SLM Z Maxwell Mounts for the Z Axis of DooKi3 or Annex Engineering K3
These files are designed to be SLM printed out of aluminum.


## Notes
The 8mm shaft holes in the maxwell mounts may need bored out to fit the shaft.

The 8mm shafts are designed to be held in with M3 bolts as set screws and/or retaining compound.  There are holes that either be tapped for M3 or drilled and tapped for M3 helicoils.  Helicoils are recommended for longevity.

These should be the approximate weights for these parts in aluminum:
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Maxwell_Front: 12.3g
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Maxwell_Front_Mirror: 12.3g
- MP_DooKi3_SLM_Z_Maxwell_Rear: 10.3g
